def register_exit_fun(fun=None, signals=[signal.SIGTERM],
                      logfun=lambda s: print(s, file=sys.stderr)):
    """Register a function which will be executed on "normal"
    interpreter exit or in case one of the `signals` is received
    by this process (differently from atexit.register()).
    Also, it makes sure to execute any other function which was
    previously registered via signal.signal(). If any, it will be
    executed after our own `fun`.

    Functions which were already registered or executed via this
    function will be ignored.

    Note: there's no way to escape SIGKILL, SIGSTOP or os._exit(0)
    so don't bother trying.

    You can use this either as a function or as a decorator:

        @register_exit_fun
        def cleanup():
            pass

        # ...or

        register_exit_fun(cleanup)

    Note about Windows: I tested this some time ago and didn't work
    exactly the same as on UNIX, then I didn't care about it
    anymore and didn't test since then so may not work on Windows.

    Parameters:

    - fun: a callable
    - signals: a list of signals for which this function will be
      executed (default SIGTERM)
    - logfun: a logging function which is called when a signal is
      received. Default: print to standard error. May be set to
      None if no logging is desired.
